Dear Principal's Name,

I am writing to inform you that I will be taking a week-long absence from college, starting from [Date] and returning on [Date]. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and would like to provide a valid reason for my absence.

Over the past few weeks, I have been facing some personal issues that I need to attend to. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I have been experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, which has affected my academic performance and overall well-being. I have been advised by a healthcare professional to take a break and focus on my mental health during this time.

I have made sure to catch up on all my assignments and deadlines prior to my absence, and I will make sure to complete all my coursework as soon as I return to college. I will also be available by email if any urgent matters arise during my absence.

I would like to request your approval for my absence and assure you that I will make every effort to minimize the impact on my academic progress. If there is anything I can do to make up for the lost time or if you need any further information from me, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to returning to college refreshed and ready to continue my studies.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
