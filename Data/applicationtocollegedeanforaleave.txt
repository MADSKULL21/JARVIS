Dear Dean [Last Name],

I am writing to request a leave of absence from [College Name] for [length of time]. I understand that this is a significant decision, and I want to assure you that I have given it careful consideration.

Due to [briefly mention the reason for leave, e.g., personal or family emergency, health issue, etc.], I require some time to attend to this pressing matter. I am confident that with this brief break, I will be able to address the issue and return to my studies with renewed focus and energy.

I have reviewed the college's leave policy and understand the procedures for requesting a leave. I am willing to provide any necessary documentation or information to support my request. I would like to request a leave of absence starting from [date] and returning to the college on [date].

I will ensure that all my coursework and assignments are up to date, and I will make arrangements to catch up on any missed work upon my return. I am committed to my studies and am eager to continue making progress towards my degree.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my request for a leave of absence. If there is any additional information or documentation required, please let me know. I can be reached at [email address] or [phone number] if you need to discuss this further.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
