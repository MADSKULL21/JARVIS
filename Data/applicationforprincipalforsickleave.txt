Dear [Principal's Name],

I am writing to request a leave of absence for the next [number of days] days due to illness. Unfortunately, I have been unwell and am currently under the care of a doctor. My doctor has advised me to take some time off to recover and I will not be able to return to school until I am deemed fit by my medical practitioner.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am able to return to school. I will also ensure that all my tasks and responsibilities are completed in a timely manner to minimize any disruption to the school's operations.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my request for sick leave. If there is any additional information or documentation required, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Principal, [School Name]

Note: Please modify the letter as per your requirement and school's policies.
