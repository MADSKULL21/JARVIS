Dear Principal's Name,

I am writing to inform you that I will be taking a week-long absence from college, starting from [Date] and returning on [Date]. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and would like to provide a valid reason for my absence.

I am taking this break to focus on my personal well-being and attend to some pressing matters. I will ensure that I catch up on any missed assignments and coursework upon my return.

I would like to request your approval for my absence and assure you that I will make every effort to minimize the impact on my academic progress. If there is anything I can do to make up for the lost time or if you need any further information from me, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Please note that you should fill in the brackets with your own information and dates.
